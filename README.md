# Machine-Learning:

## HW1: 
The first homework aims to study the relationship between the final exam grade (the target variable) and other assessments (input variables) in the grades.csv attached file.
Different algorithms were used to determine that relationship, such as Linear Regression and Gradient Descent.

## HW2:
The second homework aims to explore the logistic regression machine learning model. It also helps understand the effect of different deceion boundreis on the same data. 

## Project: 
The goal of this project is to build and evaluate machine learning models for classifying images of clothes from the Fashion-MNIST dataset.
a validation set was created by randomly splitting the 60,000 training examples into 40,000 examples for the training set and 20,000 examples for the validation set.
Each Image was represented as a vector from its raw pixel. Another feature used for comparison is the HOG feature.
KNN's nearest neighbor was used as a baseline model. SVM  and Random Forest models were used to observe if better results could be obtained. 
All the models were evaluated and compared. Falsely classified samples were examined to understand the weaknesses of each model and how to improve.
